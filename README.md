- Emergency controls and quick actions for live sessions
- Exportable session reports and filters for post-session review
- Small, reusable UI components under `src/components`

## Tech stack

## How to contribute

- Follow existing code and component patterns in `src/components`.
- Keep logic encapsulated in small components and move shared utilities into `src/utils`.
- Add unit or integration tests for new features when possible.
- Open issues or PRs with clear descriptions and screenshots when relevant.

## Where to look in the code

- Candidate management pages: `src/pages/candidate-management`
- Interview dashboard pages: `src/pages/interview-dashboard`
- Live monitoring: `src/pages/live-monitoring-panel`
- Session reports: `src/pages/session-reports`
- Shared UI primitives: `src/components/ui`
